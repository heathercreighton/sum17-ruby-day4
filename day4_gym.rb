# A gym has hired you to solve a problem. Most of their clients are fairly new to weightlifting and don’t know what to put on the barbell for a particular weight. The weights they have made available are in 45, 35, 25, 15, 10 and 5 lbs. increments. Build them a Ruby application that will tell them, for a given weight, what plates to put on each side of the bar. Bear in mind that the bar itself weighs 45 lbs.

# For example, if they want to load 225 lbs. on the bar, they will need to put two 45 lbs. plates on each side of the bar. 45x4 = 180 lbs. Plus 45 lbs. for the barbell itself equals a total of 225 lbs. 

# Hint: You don't really need to create Objects for this one, so you get a break from that. But you will need to create methods!

def choose_weight 

#user inputs weight.  
	puts "Enter the weight you would like to lift in order to know which weight to use.  It must be more than at least 55lbs and a multiple of 5lbs."


	print "Your weight:"
	lift = gets.chomp.to_i

	if  lift == 45 
		puts "The bar weighs 45 lbs.  No additional weights needed."
	elsif	lift < 45
		puts "You must enter a minimun value of 45lb. Try again."
		choose_weight #allow the user to enter a weight again.

	elsif lift%5 != 0 
		puts "Sorry, that's not a valid choice! Try again."
		choose_weight	#allow the user to enter a weight again.
	else
		weights(lift) #call the method to choose the best weight size based on user input.
